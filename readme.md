This is a very simple console application to help me with wordle puzzles.


The application has a collection of 5 letter words and it will choose one (at random) you then type this into Wordle, when you get an answer back on the letters you then tell the application the correct/incorrect letters through 0-1-2 values

0 : That letter does not exist in the word
1 : That letter is in the word but not in that location
2 : That letter is in the word at that location

the application will then eliminate the words according to the rules and then suggest another (random) word until it gets it right
